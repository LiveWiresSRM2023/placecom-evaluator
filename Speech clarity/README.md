# Speech Clarity Evaluation Pipeline

This pipeline evaluates the clarity of speech from transcribed text, focusing on fluency and naturalness using sentiment analysis techniques.

## Overview

This Python script uses Hugging Face Transformers for sentiment analysis to assess the clarity of transcribed speech. It calculates a fluency score based on the naturalness of the text, aiding in the evaluation of speech clarity.

## Features

- **Transcription Validation**: Validates accuracy of transcription.
- **Fluency Evaluation**: Measures naturalness and flow of speech.
- **Pronunciation Assessment**: Checks clarity and pronunciation of words.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Hugging Face Transformers library (`pip install transformers`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
   cd repository
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers
   ```

## Usage

1. Replace `good_text` and `bad_text` variables in `evaluate_speech.py` with your transcribed texts.

2. Run the script to evaluate speech clarity:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_speech.py
   ```

## Example

```python
# Example transcribed text (replace with your actual transcribed text)
good_text = """
Hello everyone, my name is Sarah Johnson. I have a background in project management
and have led several successful initiatives in my previous roles.
"""

bad_text = """
Uh, hi, um, I'm John. I uh, I've done some stuff with, uh, projects, I guess.
"""

# Preprocess transcribed text
clean_good_text = preprocess_text(good_text)
clean_bad_text = preprocess_text(bad_text)

# Evaluate fluency
good_fluency_score = evaluate_fluency(clean_good_text)
bad_fluency_score = evaluate_fluency(clean_bad_text)

# Print results
print("Good Example Fluency Score:", good_fluency_score)
print("Bad Example Fluency Score:", bad_fluency_score)
```
